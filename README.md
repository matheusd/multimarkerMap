Multimarker Map Site

A quick and dirty proof-of-concept website for generic marker website, using
google maps API.

This is meant as a demo of the google maps api and is **NOT MEANT FOR 
PRODUCTION**.

This code *IS* vulnerable to a variety of attacks, is not scalable, concurrent,
does not use a database, will consume your server resources and your google
API limits.

Use at your own risk.
